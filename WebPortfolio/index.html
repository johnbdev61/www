        <p>After graduating college, I went to work for a company that sells and services manufacturing equipment. I gained technical knowledge about our product offering and over the years I developed myself into an outside sales representative.</p>
        <p>As a student at Thinkful, I have begun my journey as a software developer, and I am excited to integrate my sales skills into software development.</p>
